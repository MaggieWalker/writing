As I have been told, and then seen for myself: I should be blogging. Blogging is an important way for programmers to share their process, completed work, and the tricks & tips they pick up along the way. As someone who is new to code, (and also a person that doesn't write as often as I should...) it feels intimidating to try to capture and package the things I'm learning along the way in any sort of cohesive fashion. However, that should not stop me from nudging myself into the uncomfortable world of blogging about code. 

So,

here I am. Writing my first blog post in the first text editor I have ever used: `Visual Studio Code`. 


A code snippet:
{% highlight javascript %}
const sayHello = function(name){
  console.log(`Hello there, ${name}!`)
}
sayHello('Amelia')
// logs 'Hello there, Amelia' to the console!
{% endhighlight %}
