I donâ€™t know if this is necessarily a faux pas in the coding world, but since Iâ€™ve been learning code I have very rarely seen people notebooking. Whiteboarding, **sure**! Notebooking, not so much. I am a very big notebook thinker and have been for as long as I can remember. In college, I would write entire final papers completely in my notebook before typing up the 7-10 pages of first draft scribbles. There is something particularly gratifying and, for me, uniquely effective about writing out my thoughts, as if I can capture my process of thinking much more accurately by drawing it out on paper. In fact, as Iâ€™m typing this I wish I had a paper and pen to be circling, underlining, and otherwise stylizing words as I write them, drawing arrows from one part of the page to another, using different colors to organize and chunk my thoughts. 

 It is no wonder, then, that when I started the Grace Hopper coding bootcamp, my notebook became one of my favorite learning tools. Despite the fact that I was now decidedly shifting into the world of computers, my notebook remained the best way for me to sort out my thoughts, make connections, and solidify new knowledge. As I continue learning at the Recurse Center, and especially as I continually encounter new technologies (technologies whose interactions arenâ€™t always immediately apparent) diagramming and writing in my notebook remains a key way in which I learn. I wanted to share some pictures of the pages in my notebook as a way to display my messy, non-linear process of learning, and to give an alternative example of what technical learning *might* look like.
