Whiteboarding, &lt;strong&gt;sure&lt;/strong&gt;! Notebooking, not so much. I am a very big notebook thinker and have been for as long as I can remember. In college, I would write entire final papers completely in my notebook before typing up the 7-10 pages of first draft scribbles. There is something particularly gratifying and, for me, uniquely effective about writing out my thoughts, as if I can capture my process of thinking much more accurately by drawing it out on paper. In fact, as Iâ€™m typing this I wish I had a paper and pen to be circling, underlining, and otherwise stylizing words as I write them, drawing arrows from one part of the page to another, using different colors to organize and chunk my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no wonder, then, that when I started the Grace Hopper coding bootcamp, my notebook became one of my favorite learning tools. Despite the fact that I was now decidedly shifting into the world of computers, my notebook remained the best way for me to sort out my thoughts, make connections, and solidify new knowledge. As I continue learning at the Recurse Center, and especially as I continually encounter new technologies (technologies whose interactions arenâ€™t always immediately apparent) diagramming and writing in my notebook remains a key way in which I learn. I wanted to share some pictures of the pages in my notebook as a way to display my messy, non-linear process of learning, and to give an alternative example of what technical learning &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please do forgive my astoundingly bad handwriting and occasional expletive&lt;/em&gt;ðŸ˜Š&lt;/p&gt;

Blogging is an important way for programmers to share their process, completed work, and the tricks &amp;amp; tips they pick up along the way. As someone who is newer to code, it feels intimidating to try to capture and package the things Iâ€™m learning along the way in any sort of cohesive fashion. However, that should not stop me from nudging myself into the world of blogging about code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here I am. Writing my first blog post in the first text editor I have ever used: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A code snippet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sayHello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`Hello there, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;!`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sayHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Amelia'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// logs 'Hello there, Amelia' to the console!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
