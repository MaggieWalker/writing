Hi, there! My name is Maggie Walker, I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina, I am currently living in Brooklyn, and I love to tinker. Previously, I taught high school science in Bushwick, and now I am diving head first into the world of computers. I love hip-hop, techno, and radical kindness. My intention is always to help build and support positive communities, so please feel free to reach out to me @ `mags21walker@gmail.com` to grab a coffee or dance outside!
